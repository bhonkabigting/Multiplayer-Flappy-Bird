# Multiplayer Flappy Bird

## About the Project
• A multiplayer adaptation of the popular Flappy Bird game which I developed within 4 days.
• The game allows two players to compete in real-time while spectators can view the gameplay. 
• In the event that a player quits, a spectator can replace them on a first-come, first-served basis.
• Technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express, Socket.IO
